\begin{question}{RL Exploration Strategies}{10}
	In which spaces can you perform exploration in RL? Discuss the two  exploration strategies applicable to RL.
	
\begin{answer}
Exploration can be performed in action Space and Parameter space.

Parameter Space:\\
In Episode Based Policy Search a distribution is learned over the parameters of the low level control policy. Exploration in parameter space allows more sophisticated strategies and is often very efficient for a small amount of parameters. 

Action Space:\\
In Step Based Policy Search there is less variance in quality assessment. Moreover as the exploration happens in action space it is less likely to create unstable policies.
