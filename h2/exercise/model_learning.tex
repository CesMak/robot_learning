\exercise{Model Learning}
The new and improved Spinbot 2000 is a multi-purpose robot platform.
It is made of a kinematic chain consisting of a linear axis $q_{1}$, a rotational axis $q_{2}$ and another linear axis $q_{3}$, as shown in the figure below.
These three joints are actuated with forces and torques of $u_{1}$, $u_{2}$, and $u_{3}$.
Different end effectors, including a gripper or a table tennis racket, can be mounted on the end of the robot, indicated by the letter $E$.
Thanks to Spinbot's patented SuperLight technology, the robot's mass is distributed according to one point mass of $m_{1}$ at the second joint and another point mass of $m_{2}$ at the end of the robot $E$.

The inverse dynamics model of the Spinbot is given as
\begin{align*}
u_{1} &= (m_{1}+m_{2})(\ddot{q}_{1}+g),\\
u_{2} &= m_{2}(2\dot{q}_{3}\dot{q}_{2}q_{3}+q_{3}^{2}\ddot{q}_{2}),\\
u_{3} &= m_{2}(\ddot{q}_{3}-q_{3}\dot{q}_{2}^{2}).
\end{align*}
We now collected 100 samples from the robot while using a PD controller with gravity compensation at a rate of 500Hz.
The collected data (see \texttt{spinbotdata.txt}) is organized as follows\\
\begin{tabular}{| l || c | c | c | l  }
  \hline
   & $t_1$ & $t_2$ & $t_3$ & \ldots\\
  \hline
  \hline
  $q_{1}[m]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  $q_{2}[rad]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  $q_{3}[m]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  \ldots &  &  &  &  \\
  \hline
  $\ddot{q}_{3}[m/s^{2}]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  $u_{1}[N]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  $u_{2}[Nm]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
  $u_{3}[N]$ &  &  &  & \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

Given this data, you want to learn the inverse dynamics of the robot to use a model-based controller.
The inverse dynamics of the system will be modeled as $\vec{u}=\vec{\phi}(\vec{q},\dot{\vec{q}},\ddot{\vec{q}})^{\T}\vec{\theta}$, where $\vec{\phi}(\vec{q},\dot{\vec{q}},\ddot{\vec{q}})$ are features and $\vec{\theta}$ are the parameters.

\begin{question}{Learning the Parameters}{2}
You want to compute the parameters $\vec{\theta}$ minimizing the squared error between the estimated forces/torques and the actual forces/torques.
Write down the matrix equation that you would use to compute the parameters. For each matrix in the equation, write down its size.\\
Then, compute the least-squares estimate of the parameters $\vec{\theta}$ from the data and report the learned values.
